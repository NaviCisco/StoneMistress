## Controls
- **Rate**: Controls the rate of the LFO signal that modulates the speed at which the notches created by the All-Pass filters sweep back and forth across the spectrum.
The same principle is applied to the comb filter created by the delay unit that originates the chorus effect.
- **Phaser depth**: Controls the sweeping range of the All-Pass notches. The more the Depth, the more pronounced the phasing effect.
- **Chorus depth**: Controls the amount of delay time applied by the delay unit. The more you turn the knob clockwise, the more pronounced the chorus effect.
- **Color**: When engaged, adds a default amount of feedback to the Phaser. Notice how the Stone Mistress carves into the frequency spectrum hollowing out the sound. Fundamentals and harmonics glide in and out for an extremely pronounced phasing/shifting effect.


## Overview
The Stone Mistress consists of a 4-Stages Phaser and a Chorus unit in chain, modulated by a single LFO generator.\
