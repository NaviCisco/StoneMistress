- **Rate**: Controls the rate of the LFO signal that modulates the speed at which the notches created by the All-Pass filters sweep back and forth across the spectrum.
The same principle is applied to the comb filter created by the delay unit that originates the chorus effect.
- **Phaser depth**: Controls the sweeping range of the All-Pass notches. The more the Depth, the more pronounced the phasing effect.
- **Chorus depth**: Controls the amount of delay time applied by the delay unit. The more you turn the knob clockwise, the more pronounced the chorus effect.


## Overview
The Stone Mistress consists of a 4-Stages Phaser and a Chorus unit in chain, modulated by a single LFO generator.\
